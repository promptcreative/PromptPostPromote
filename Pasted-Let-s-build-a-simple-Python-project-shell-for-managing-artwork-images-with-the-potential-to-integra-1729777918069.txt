Let's build a simple Python project shell for managing artwork images, with the potential to integrate Google Drive or Dropbox later. For now, we'll focus on handling local image uploads, processing the images, and displaying the results on a basic React page.

Here’s what the project needs to do:

1. **Image Handling**:
   - Set up a function to handle images that are uploaded locally (we will simulate this for now with sample images from an open-source dataset like Unsplash or Pexels).
   - Automatically rename each image using a simple pattern (e.g., from 'artwork_01.jpg' to 'renamed_artwork_01.jpg').

2. **Placeholder for Google Drive/Dropbox Integration**:
   - Add a placeholder in the code where, in the future, we can integrate Google Drive or Dropbox to fetch and store images. No need to connect these services now, but keep it in mind for later steps.

3. **Content Generation**:
   - For each image, create a placeholder for generated descriptions, captions, and hashtags. For now, just generate simple placeholder text like "Description for artwork_01" and "Hashtag for artwork_01."

4. **Exporting**:
   - Create a simple export function that saves the artwork's filename, description, and hashtags into a CSV file. Each row in the CSV should represent an image and its corresponding data.

5. **React Frontend**:
   - Build a simple React page that displays the processed results in a table format.
   - The table should show the image in one column, and the corresponding description, hashtags, and captions in the other columns.
   - Allow me to upload images or simulate this for now by showing placeholder images (e.g., from Unsplash or Pexels).

6. **Environment Setup**:
   - Ensure that I can add images to the project folder and easily run the script to process those images (rename, generate content, and export to CSV).
   - The results should then be shown on the React frontend after processing.

For now, I want to work with local files only, but please leave comments in the code to indicate where we could integrate Google Drive or Dropbox in the future. Let’s focus on building the shell and basic functionality for image processing and displaying the results on the frontend.
