CONTEXT: PROJECT NAME: PromptPostPromote/Astrobatching GITHUB URL: https://github.com/promptcreative/PromptPostPromote PURPOSE: Astrobatch promotion calendar and agency tools designed to manage and optimize content posting schedules across various platforms, facilitating efficient promotional activities. CURRENT STATUS: Experimental; Initial setup with core features like user role-based access, branding updates, and artwork scheduling in development. More advanced features like client portals and optimal posting timings are included but require further refinement. ARCHITECTURE: Monolithic Python Flask application utilizing a PostgreSQL database for persistence. Integrates various libraries for handling scheduling, authentication, and API requests to external services such as OpenAI. Primarily focuses on a single server solution with templating through Flask's built-in Jinja. TECH STACK: Python 3.11, Flask 3.0.3, Flask-SQLAlchemy 3.1.1, PostgreSQL, OpenAI API, Requests 2.32.5, SQLAlchemy 2.0.36, Pandas 3.0.0, Werkzeug 3.0.4, Flask-Login 0.6.3, Flask-Dance 7.1.0 USER FLOW: User signs up or logs in -> Selects or uploads artwork -> Schedules postings using provided calendar tools -> Receives feedback on optimal posting times and updates content accordingly -> Can access client portal if applicable. HOW TO RUN: Clone the repository; Ensure Python 3.11 is installed; Set up virtual environment; Install dependencies through 'pip install -r requirements.txt'; Configure .env file with appropriate environment variables such as DATABASE_URL; Run the application using 'flask run'. KEY FILES: - app.py — Primary entry point of the Flask application. - main.py — Handles main application logic and startup. - publer_service.py — Integration logic for Publer-related functionalities. - routes.py — Defines the application routes and handling logic. - models.py — Defines database schema and ORM models. - utils.py — Utility functions shared across the application. - templates/index.html — Landing page template for the web application. - templates/login.html — User login page template. DEPENDENCIES: - OpenAI (api) — Used for AI-driven content analysis or recommendations. - PostgreSQL (database) — Central database for managing scheduling, user data, and other persistent entities.
