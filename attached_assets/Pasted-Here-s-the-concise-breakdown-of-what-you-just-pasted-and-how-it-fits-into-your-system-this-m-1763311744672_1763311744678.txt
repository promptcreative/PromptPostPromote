Here’s the **concise breakdown** of what you just pasted — and **how it fits into your system this morning**.

# ⭐ What This Workflow Actually Does

This is your **Multiplatform Social Media Content Creator with Human Approval** flow.

It takes a post idea from your Google Sheet → generates platform-specific content → sends it to GoToHuman for approval → updates the sheet based on “approved” or “rejected.”

---

# 🧩 Simple Explanation of the Flow

### **1. Trigger**

* Runs manually (Execute Workflow)
* Or on a schedule (though schedule is empty right now)

### **2. Pull Ideas from Sheet**

* Reads rows where `APPROVED` is blank
* Sends each row into the loop

### **3. For each idea:**

1. **Social Media Content Creator (AI Agent)**

   * Uses Claude Sonnet 4.5
   * Generates the actual post for **Instagram / LinkedIn / Facebook / X**
   * Output → `$json.output`

2. **Set Text**

   * Packages that output for human review

3. **Send to GoToHuman**

   * Human sees the draft
   * Approves or rejects
   * Human can also edit the text

4. **Switch**

   * If APPROVED → update row in sheet (POST + APPROVED = “x”)
   * If REJECTED → trigger **Set new prompt** to create a revised version

     * Then runs the AI generator again

5. **Loop**

   * Continues until all ideas are processed

# ⭐ In Plain English

This workflow:

**Turns your spreadsheet ideas → full social posts → sends them to a human → updates the spreadsheet.**

# 🛠 Should you switch this to Tavily-style sentiment + hype?

**No — this workflow is different.**

This is for **content creation**, not:

* sentiment searches
* Hollywood hype
* box office scanning
* Tavily research
* Worth The Watch

But you *can* merge ideas.

For example:

### **Future Upgrade**

Add a Tavily node before the Social Media Creator →
Have the AI use live trending topics to shape the post.

You literally could have:

* “Pull sentiment for my niche”
* “Identify trending keywords”
* “Rewrite post idea using hot topics right now”

Your posts would be instantly trend-aware.

### Want me to:

**A)** Clean up this workflow?
**B)** Integrate Tavily trend research into the content generator?
**C)** Turn this into a full “Daily Trend-Aware Content Machine”?
**D)** Build a matching version in Replit / API format for your app?

Which direction do you want?
